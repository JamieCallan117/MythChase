# MythChase | CS-384 Coursework

This coursework was to take an existing game, in this case Pac-man, and create our own Unity based project around that style.

The game features a simple menu to view the leaderboards for the 3 levels and also view progress on achievements. When selecting the play button you are presented with the 3 levels to choose from and after selecting the level you have the choice of 5 characters.

Each character performs the same however they each have a unique power-up, but other than that the game functions the same for each character.
